Description: Welcome to the Study-Specific Quality, Utility, and Breadth Assessment (SQUBA) ecosystem! 
    This is a "verse" package that will download all currently available modules and the support function package. 
    Each module is encapsulated in its own package, so they are also available to download in isolation if you 
    would rather not install the full suite.
